# Google Maps Platform resources for AI

## **Description**

This repository contains the Google Maps Platform Code Assist toolkit, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enhances the responses from large language models (LLMs) used for developing applications with the Google Maps Platform by grounding them in the official, up-to-date documentation and code samples.

For more information about installing and using the toolkit, as well as terms of use, see the [Code Assist toolkit README](packages/code-assist/README.md).
